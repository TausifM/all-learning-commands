# Today I got stuck in the new calender 

I am working on 5288 location icon ticket and got error for schedule libray in @synfusion 

So I deleted the node version down grade it to 12.22.12 
and as well npm version 6.14.16 

Then I also getting error So I did 


finally again install the ssh git clone of the project 

then git checkout the release branch 

where the project code is push by dev

git checkout rc/may_2022-release branch then 

git pull origin rc/may_2022-release branch

then git checkout that ticket parent branch i.e

git checkout feature/gngr-1085-release branch

then git pull origin feature/gngr-1085-release

then makig then branch in which I did work i.e

git checkout -b feature/gngr-5288-dev branch 

publish the branch first then work 

and commit it at the last when code is done
